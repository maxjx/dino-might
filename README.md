<p><b>Project:</b> DinoMight - A 2D platformer with an interactive storyline which aims to promote effective habits that reduces stress.</p>
<p><b>Proposed level of achievment:</b> Artemis</p>
<p><b>Project scope:</b> O</p> 

<h2> Milestone 1 (Ideation)</h2>
<p><b>Motivation:</b>
Stress in Singapore is a significant issue considering that 92% of Singaporeans report feelings of stress, with some even indicating unmanageable levels of stress.
A persistent high level of stress will narrow a person’s ability to think, cope and to function effectively. Oftentimes, poor management of stress can be attributed to poor stress management techniques or simply being unaware of good stress relief habits. There is a need to raise awareness on the various ways that can effectively combat stress.
Interested in the mechanics of game design and raising awareness through story-telling, we seek to create an interactive fantasy world where the user controls a dino as the main character. This is a 2D adventure/educational game with an interactive storyline which changes based on the player’s decisions that brings the player through a journey of mental self-discovery.</p>
